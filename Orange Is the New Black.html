Her counsellor, Sam Healy, sympathizes with her and tries to gently give her tips to survive. She grapples with the racial dynamics of prison life and learns some of the rules. Unfortunately, she offends Red, the powerful matriarch of the prison kitchen, who responds by serving Piper a bloody tampon and subsequently starving her. Piper is then shocked to discover that <a href="/wiki/Alex_Vause" title="Alex Vause">Alex Vause</a>, her former lover (who recruited her into carrying drug money) is in the same prison. Flashbacks depict the particulars of Piper's crime, Piper telling her family about her crime, and Larry's marriage proposal.

Piscatella, one of the new CO’s, is strict on security and obedience, and is feared by both guards and inmates. He is made captain of the guards. Maureen wants to escape the prison with Suzanne, but Suzanne doesn’t want to run away and goes back to the prison. Maureen is eventually captured by Caputo. The new inmates are integrated with the old inmates. Everyone gets a bunkmate. Red’s bunkmate snores to her annoyance. Judy King becomes a prisoner at Litchfield and forms a bond with Luschek. She is given special treatment as she gets her own private room. Alex is saved from Aydin Bayat, Kubra's enforcer, by Lolly who kicks him repeatedly until he is unconscious. They both presume he is dead. Alex sneaks into the greenhouse to attempt to bury Aydin and realizes he is still breathing which causes her to smother him. In the morning as they enter the greenhouse, they see that Frieda has discovered Aydin’s body. With Frieda’s help, they cut the body into smaller parts and bury it under plants in the garden.</td>

Piper loses employees in her illegal panty business as they think that it is becoming too dangerous. Maria tries to help her fellow Dominicans by asking Piper if they could join her business but Piper declines, stating that she doesn’t want thugs. So instead, the Dominicans decide to start their own panty business. Caputo goes on a date with Linda and in the restaurant he sees one of the CO’s that walked out working as a busboy.

Brook tries to talk to Judy and explain why Poussey acts weird in front of her but lies about Poussey’s past in order to get Judy’s acceptance. She falsely claims that Poussey is poor and her mother is a crack addict and acts strange because Judy is rich and white. Judy invites Poussey to have lunch with her, but when Poussey hears Brook lied to Judy, she abruptly leaves lunch, insulted that Brook knows nothing about her. It is shown that in Brook’s past, she exaggerated the truth to be accepted. Brook apologizes to Poussey and promises to make an effort to know her. Lolly begins to crack and attempts to dig up Aydin’s body in the garden but Alex stops her. Frieda sees Lolly’s instability and states that they are going to have to kill Lolly.</td>

At the convention, Caputo gets into an altercation with Danny Pearson, who attempts to use the event to speak out against the system, and is arrested.

In an effort to stop Maria from cutting into her panty business, Piper requests and is given permission by Piscatella to form a security group.
